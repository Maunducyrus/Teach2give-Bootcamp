JS tutorials

including js in html
1. use scripts -<script></script>
2. external js - <srcipt src=""></script>

to improve JS performance
defer keyword - 
node index.js running via node

variables - container that holds a piece of info
const - value that doesn't change
value - actual piece of data stored inside a varialbe

declaring valiable
var- older keyword for Js
let- keyword for modern JS
const-constant

declaring a variable
var age;
initializing a variable
age = 20;

name variable
1. you start with dollar, sign, underscore
2. Variable names are case sensitive

snake case convention
let = seconds_tomorrow_morning

camel case convention
let = seconds_Tomorrow_Morning

pascal case convention
let = SecondsTomorrowMorning

JS datatypes
1. string - uses single or double quotes
2. Number - numbers
3. Boolean - true or false
4. Null = intentional absence of a value
5. Undefined - returns value declared and not initialized
6. Bigint
7. Symbol

typeof operator - to check the datatype of a variable

Operators - performs operations

1. Arithmetic
2. Logical - for boolean logic 
3. Bitwise - perform operations at the binary level

post-increment a++ returns the value first and
then increments
pre-increment ++a

= assign a value to a variable
+= used to a value a variable
-= minues a value from a variable and updates it immediately
*=
/=

comparison operators
== (Equality operator) - ignores datatypes
=== (Strict equality operator) - strict on datatypes.

!= Not equal to
!== Strict inequality operator

&& everything has to be true for it to return true
|| returns true if one operator is true

! negatis the result

let senderfirstName = "Cyrus"
let senderLastName = "Maundu"
let currentBalance = "5_500"
let receivedAmount = "2_500"

console.log("TJDIIWOSF19. Confirmed! You have received Ksh. " + receivedAmount + "from " + senderFirstName + "New m-pesa balance is Ksh."

String Template Literals
console.log(``)

Type Coercion and Type Conversion
- changing datatype of a value to another

Type Coercion - happens automatically 
eg ("5" + 5)

Type Conversion - when you convert the datatype of a particular value
eg num1 = String(num1)
console.log(Number(55))

num1 = Number(num1)
num1 = parseInt(num1)
num1 = Boolean(num1)

Function - block of code that performs a specific task 

function functionName() {

}
calling the function

Parameters - variable declared in a function
argument - value passed to a function 

types of functions in JS
1. function declaration
2. function expression/anonymous function
3. Arrow functions
eg const multiply = (num1, num2) => {
return num1 * num2;
}

Callback function - refer to the function passed 

Control Flow

1. Conditional 
- if statement
- if else statement if---else
- if else ladder - else---if
const score = 95
if (score >= 90) {
console.log('You score an A')
} 
- switch statement

2. Loops
- for loop - used when the number of excution for a block of code is known
- while loop - executes a code until a certain condition is met
- do while loop - executes a loop atleast once even is it's wrong

infinite loop - a loop that never stops

Scope - determines where variable are accessible

types of scope
1. Global Scope - variable declared out side any function or block

2. Function scope(local scope) - variable declared inside a function is only accessible inside that function.

3. Block scope - uses let and const
4. Lexical scope - means a function can access variables from it's parent scope.

var - is not a block scope keyword

Basic Data Structures
- Arrays - collection of elements stored at contiguous memory locations
const ArrayName = [item1, item2, item3]
console.log(ArrayName[0])

- Objects - stores values as a collection of key value pairs. the key must be a string and value can be of any type.
creating objects-
- object literal
- using new Object()
- Using a constructor function

- Sets
- Maps

method - function inside a object.

Sets - represent collection of unique values
 - add
 - delete
 - has
 - clear
 
 Maps - allows storage of key value pairs
 the key can be of any type.
 
 Document Object Model.
 
 Changing DOM Elements
 - innerHTML - use to inject some HTML elements
 - innerText - 
 - element.attribute - value
 
 DOM Events
 - action or occurrence thta happens in the browser which user can respond.
 - onclick event
 - onmouseover event
 - onkeydown
 - onkeyup
 - onloaad
 - onfocus
